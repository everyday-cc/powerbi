name: "GROUPBY  (<table>, [<groupBy_columnName1>], [<name>, <expression>]â€¦ )"
excerpt: "The GROUPBY function is similar to the SUMMARIZE function. However, GROUPBY does not do an implicit CALCULATE for any extension columns that it adds. GROUPBY permits a new function, CURRENTGROUP(), to be used inside aggregation functions in the extension columns that it adds. GROUPBY attempts to reuse the data that has been grouped making it highly performant."
