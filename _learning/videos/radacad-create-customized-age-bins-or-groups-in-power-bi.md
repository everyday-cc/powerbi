title: "Create Customized Age Bins or Groups in Power BI"
excerpt: "Power BI has the built-in feature of creating binning for a numeric field such as age. However, the default binning will create bins of equal size. If you want to create bins of different sizes, then you need to create that as a custom column. Fortunately, Power Query has transformations that can help."
