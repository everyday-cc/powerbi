A Solution Architect ensures that the solution meets the customer’s needs now and in the future. While the Solution Architect may not “click the buttons” during a deployment, they are ultimately responsible for the solution and work closely with the deployment team.\nThis learning path covers the pre-sales and analysis phases of a project to include:\n\nWhat it takes to become a Solution Architect.\nDiscovering customer needs.\nProposing a solution.\nWorking with requirements.\nPerforming fit-gap analysis.\n\nInstructor-led training (ILT) is scheduled for March 2020 that provides more hands-on activities and both this path and ILT are needed for the exam.",
