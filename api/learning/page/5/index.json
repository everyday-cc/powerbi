You will learn about using DAX language to create measures. Those measures will help you create a wide variety of analytic solutions. Additionally, you’ll learn how to improve performance with your Power Query data retrieval tasks.",

If your data is coming in from more than one transactional system, before you know it, you can have dozens of tables that you have to work with. Building a great data model is about simplifying the disarray. A star schema is one way to simplify a data model, and you’ll learn about the terminology and implementation of them in this module. You will also learn about why choosing the correct data granularity is important for performance and usability of your Power BI reports. Finally, you’ll learn about improving performance with your Power BI data models.",
