A Solution Architect ensures that the solution meets the customer’s needs now and in the future. While the Solution Architect may not “click the buttons” during a deployment, they are ultimately responsible for the solution and work closely with the deployment team.\nThis learning path covers the pre-sales and analysis phases of a project to include:\n\nWhat it takes to become a Solution Architect.\nDiscovering customer needs.\nProposing a solution.\nWorking with requirements.\nPerforming fit-gap analysis.\n\nInstructor-led training (ILT) is scheduled for March 2020 that provides more hands-on activities and both this path and ILT are needed for the exam.",

You will also learn how to connect Power BI reports to on-premise data sources. Your users will appreciate seeing the latest data in your reports, so you will configure automatic refresh for your Power BI datasets. Row-level security allows you to create one report, but have users be restricted to see only the data that applies to them. This targets data to users, without having to create multiple reports.",
